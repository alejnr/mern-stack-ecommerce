          You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is

          <li>Typographical Errors</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          While CentCellStore strives to provide accurate product and pricing
          information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. CentCellStore
          cannot confirm the price of an item until after you order. In the
          event that an item is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect
          information due to an error in pricing or product information,
          CentCellStore shall have the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse
          or cancel any orders placed for that item. In the event that an item
          is mis-priced, CentCellStore may, at our discretion, either contact
          you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such
          cancellation.

        <h3 className='text-dark'>
          <li>Pricing in Different Currencies</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pricing of products sold by CentCellStore is based upon figures
          calculated in Euros (EUR€). Prices displayed in other currencies are
          converted from Euros according to the most up to date conversion
          rates. Due to fluctuating currency values, prices displayed in
          non-U.S. denominations of currency on the site, other than on the
          individual product page, may not be the most current. Areas of the
          site where non-EUR denominations of currency might be inaccurate
          include, but are not limited to, promotional banners, promotional
          pages, and information on product category pages. The price displayed
          on an individual product page, regardless of currency denomination, is
          the current price you are liable to pay to CentCellStore, excluding
          shipping.
